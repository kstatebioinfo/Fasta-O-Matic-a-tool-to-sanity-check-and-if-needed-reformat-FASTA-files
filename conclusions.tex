\section{Conclusions}
Overall, both memory and run time requirements were small for all three programs. However, the extra minutes taken by Fasta-O-Matic to test for fatal and non-fatal format issues may prevent hours lost waiting for an analyst to manually restart analysis or worse discover that a file was corrupt only after analysis is complete. Fasta-O-Matic was also the only tool identified that skips reformatting if none is required balancing the need to prepare data to be properly interpreted by bioinformatics tools with the practical need to conserve disk space. Fasta-O-Matic is a portable and easy to use tool to facilitate bioinformatics analysis by automating FASTA file inspection in busy bioinformatics cores.
