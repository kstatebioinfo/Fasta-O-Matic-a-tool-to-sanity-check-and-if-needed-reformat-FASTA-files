\section{Conclusions}
Overall, both memory and run time requirements were small for all three programs. However with the additional reporting from Fasta-O-matic the extra minutes taken to evaluate and report a variety of fatal and non-fatal may prevent hours lost waiting for an analyst to manually restart analysis or worse discover that a file was corrupt only after analysis is complete. Fasta-O-Matic's also was the only tool identified that skips reformatting if none is required balancing the need to prepare data to be properly interpreted by bioinformatics tools with the practical need to conserve disk space. Fasta-O-Matic is a portable and easy to use tool to facilitate bioinformatics analysis by automating FASTA file inspection in busy bioinformatics cores.
