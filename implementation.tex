\section{Implementation}

In order to fit seamlessly into an analysis workflow a FASTA format tool should should be able to detect which format issues are actually present in the FASTA file and only produce a reformatted file if the current file is actually corrupt. 


\subsection{Portability}

Where possible Fasta-O-Matic was designed to be easy to distribute and use. Fasta-O-Matic is distributed on GitHub under a the MIT license to allow for easy access to or customization of the code. The tool was also built and tested on both Python2.7 and and Python3.3 to minimize incompatibility with existing linux environments. The script generates complete help menus when called from the command line with the \verb|--help| command and from within python with \ver|help(fasta_o_matic)|. Additionally, Fasta-O-Matic includes a sample FASTA file with missing newlines, inconsistent wrapping and spaces in headers and a tutorial which describes how to reformat the sample. These features ensure that Fasta-O-Matic is easy to incorporate into existing workflows.
